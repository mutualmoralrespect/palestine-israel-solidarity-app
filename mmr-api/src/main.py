Key principles for intersectional Palestine solidarity:

1. **Centering Palestinian voices**: Amplify Palestinian perspectives and leadership in solidarity work.

2. **Connecting struggles**: Recognize links between Palestinian liberation and other justice movements (racial justice, Indigenous rights, anti-imperialism).

3. **Challenging all forms of oppression**: Address how racism, sexism, classism, and other systems intersect with colonialism.

4. **Building inclusive coalitions**: Create spaces where diverse communities can contribute to Palestinian solidarity while addressing their own liberation needs.

5. **Educational approach**: Share knowledge about Palestinian history and current conditions while connecting to broader patterns of injustice.

This approach strengthens both Palestinian liberation and other justice movements by building broader, more sustainable coalitions for change."""

- Understanding that people experience multiple, overlapping identities
- Recognizing that liberation movements must address various forms of oppression simultaneously
- Building coalitions that center the most marginalized voices
- Challenging single-issue approaches that ignore complexity

Applied to Palestine solidarity, intersectionality helps us see connections between anti-Palestinian racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of oppression, creating more comprehensive and effective resistance strategies."""

- Respect human dignity and self-determination
