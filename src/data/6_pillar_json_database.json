She issues strong moral condemnation of Hamas and powerful critique of Israeli democratic backsliding under Netanyahu. However, through an MMR lens, her alignment remains Partial: she does not consistently extend moral scrutiny to Israeli military actions harming civilians, and largely centers Israeli and Western democratic narratives over Palestinian human experiences. Nor does she outline positive peace-building strategies rooted in dignity and shared agency. To reach fuller alignment with the Mutual Moral Respect framework, Applebaum would need to balance her rigorous autocracy analysis with consistent condemnation of all civilian-targeting regardless of actor, greater empathy for Palestinians as individuals, and advocacy for mutual political solutions that uphold Palestinian rights and dignity."

His moral clarity shines in condemning civilian-targeting actions of all parties, and his labeling of Gaza as a 'concentration camp' reflects his use of sharply honest language. His structural critiques are fortified by decades of documented research and media analysis. Yet, under the MMR framework, this moral rigor is undermined by two central gaps: first, a relative attenuation of Hamas’s moral critique, framed predominantly through systemic context rather than direct ethical accountability; second, a lack of personal empathetic narrative for Israeli civilian suffering. Lastly, while Chomsky robustly calls for two‑state justice, his envisioned peace remains abstract—heavy on systemic critiques and light on a human-centered plan for shared dignity. To strengthen his alignment, Chomsky would need more balanced moral accountability for non-state actors and a richer narrative of Israeli human suffering, paired with a forward-looking, dignity-based peace framework rooted in mutual humanization."

His emotional narrative centers Palestinian trauma but gives insufficient space to Israeli civilian identity or suffering. Moreover, while he supports peaceful solutions, he rarely articulates a vision of shared future dignity in concrete, forward-looking terms.

HRW documented Hamas’s war crimes, including the October 7 massacre, yet did so through a legalistic lens that lacked explicit moral confrontation with eliminationist ideology. While Roth was forceful in holding Israeli far-right actors accountable, Israeli civilian fears and emotional realities were underrepresented in HRW narratives. HRW’s vision for peace leaned heavily on law and accountability but offered little on moral reconciliation or dignity-based coexistence. These gaps prevent a full alignment under the MMR framework, placing Roth and HRW’s approach at a Partial overall."
